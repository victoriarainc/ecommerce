### by Victoria Coleman

## Intro

Handmade by Vi, an ecommerce web application, is a passion project of mine that I wanted to bring to life with my web development skills.

## Mission

Crafting and paper goods, recycled product and handmade charm, these are all aspects of my business that I wanted to convey online to a larger audience. This web application's purpose is to showcase available product and services while delivering the story behind this project.

## Tools

HTML, CSS, and React.js
