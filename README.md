# Ecommerce Inventory Management

## Project Overview

Handmade by Vi is a small crafting business that encourages reuse, reducing of, and recycling with everyday paper goods. All projects are custom and one of a kind pieces that implement recycled elements from Durham's Scrap Exchange, Paper Source, or sourced from local artists.

## Mission

The nature of this company is more than a craft shop and requires more space for communication and community. Elements of the business such as custom items and crafting courses require a unique site to display work more like a portfolio than a shop.


### Objectives
- Create an attractive display of previously finished projects available for custom creation
- Display all available services and descriptions of them
- Increase communication between Handmade by Vi and it's customers

### Research
Kelly Miller led the research and analysis of non-profit web design. She uncovered related color theory, user experience methods, and performed SWOT analysis on other sites with similar objectives. Her education and background directly benefited the project and implemented a strategy that achieved our goals for the website.

### Community Involvement
A Facebook poll collected opinions from the volunteers of the center to talk about what they would like to see improved, how they believe the site is used most, and what questions they receive most often from members of the community.

Additionally, a suggestion box was left at the Center for a week to collect suggestions from members. These were collected and recorded for future maintenance and continued editing of the webpage as a whole.


## Future State and Roadmap
* Continue to maintain and update the site for Handmade by Vi.
* After the site proves helpful for Handmade by Vi, login authentication will be added to expand the user base to other small craft businesses and individuals.
